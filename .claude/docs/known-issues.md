# Known issues

- **Infection crashes on escaped mutants whose diff contains `<…`** ("Incorrectly nested style tag found"): the
  console formatter reads MRZ strings such as `'<<'` as style tags. `make infection` exits 1 even though the run
  finished. Kill every mutant in files with `<` literals (Icao), or inspect with
  `vendor/bin/infection --show-mutations=0` + `var/infection/infection.json`.
- **Equivalent mutants in `Icao\PersonName::mrzField()`** came from boundary branches that produce the same output;
  the code was restructured so `cut()` is called unconditionally (a shorter text is returned unchanged). Keep it that
  way rather than adding fast paths.
- **ICAO table 6.B has no Ь (soft sign)**: `Transliterator` throws for `Игорь`. Russian names need a Russian-sourced
  rule (plan task 4). Ъ → `IE`, so `Объедков` → `OBIEEDKOV` (the plan's `OBIEDKOV` was wrong).
- **PDF glyphs vs code points in Doc 9303 Part 3 §6**: rows 0402, 040E, 0110 print a different glyph than their
  code; the code column is used (see `docs/sources/ICAO.md`).
- php-cs-fixer rewrites `@link <url>` to `@see <url>` in class docblocks; source citations therefore use `@see`.
